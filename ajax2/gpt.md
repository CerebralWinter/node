The given code is written in JavaScript and uses the "Express" library to create a web server. It sets up a server that handles form submissions and sends a response with the received data.

First, the code imports the "express" library and assigns it to a variable called "express." This library provides functions and tools to create web applications easily.

Then, a variable called "app" is created and assigned the result of calling the "express" function. This "app" variable represents our web application.

Next, the code includes some prerequisites and instructions as comments. It mentions the need to install additional packages (such as "ajax," "queryselector," and "express") and create a folder called "public" to hold static files (like HTML and JavaScript files).

After that, the code sets up some middleware using the `app.use()` function. Middleware is code that sits between the server and the routes, performing various tasks. In this case, it configures middleware to handle form data.

The line `app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: true}));` enables parsing of form data. It ensures that the values submitted in the form are not just simple strings but can include other types of values.

The line `app.use(express.json());` handles the parsing of JSON data. When information is sent as JSON, it needs to be deserialized into usable data.

The line `app.use(express.static('public'));` creates a route named "public" that serves static files, such as HTML and JavaScript files. It tells the server where to find these files.

Next, the code defines a route for handling form submissions using the `app.post()` function. When the form is submitted, the function inside `app.post()` is executed. It extracts the data submitted in the form fields (name, email, checkbox, pets, area) from the `req.body` object, which holds the request body data.

The extracted data is then logged to the console using `console.log()`, displaying the received values. Finally, a response is sent back to the browser confirming the data received from the form.

Lastly, the server is set to listen on port 3000 using the `app.listen()` function. It means the server is waiting for incoming requests on port 3000, and when it receives one, it will handle it accordingly. The code also logs a message to the console indicating that the server is listening on port 3000.

In simpler terms, this code creates a web server that handles form submissions. When someone fills out a form and submits it, the server receives the form data and logs it. It then sends a response back to the browser, confirming the received data. It's like a friendly assistant who collects information from a form you fill out and lets you know that it received your data.
